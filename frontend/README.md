# Frontend Enhancements

## UX Updates
- Added loading indicators and error messaging across form-based pages (Apply, Register, Upload, PI Scheduling, Payments, Track, Officer views, Officer Queues, and Tasks) so users receive immediate feedback while API calls are in progress or fail.
- Introduced inline alerts for officer workflows (queue management, document retrieval, and task actions) that surface per-item failures without blocking the rest of the UI.
- Wrapped the routed application content in a reusable `<ErrorBoundary>` component that catches unexpected render errors and lets users retry without refreshing the page.

## Testing
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the unit build to ensure the bundle compiles: `npm run build`
3. Optionally start the dev server with `npm run dev` and exercise each screen to observe loading spinners and failure states (use browser dev tools to simulate network errors).

These steps confirm both the new defensive UI states and the global error boundary behave as expected.
